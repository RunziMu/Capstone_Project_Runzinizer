# Capstone Project: Runzinizer
This is the capstone project I made as the completion of Full Stack Web Devlopment Bootcamp

This web app is called **Runzinizer** as an combination of my firstname plus Organizer :)

Runzinizer is a web app that keep tracks of user's expenses and income, like a mini version of expense manager.
Runzinizer contains six responsive tabs, each tab contributes its own function.

**Register Tab**
Users will be asked to register a new account with Runzinizer if it's their first time use.
