# Capstone Project: Runzinizer
This is the capstone project I made as the completion of Full Stack Web Devlopment Bootcamp

This web app is called **Runzinizer** as an combination of my firstname plus Organizer :)

Runzinizer contains six tabs, each tab contributes its own function.

**Register Tab**
Users will be asked to register a new account with Runzinizer if it's their first time use.

**Login Tab**
After registration, users are asked to login to Runzinizer, otherwise the **Profile** **Home** **Search** and **Report** will be unaccessible.

**Profile Tab**
This tab shows user's basic information including name, email and *profile picture.
*Profile picture will show if the user set up during registration.

**Home Tab**
This tab shows user's transaction history. Users are also able to add more expense and income to transactions.

**Search Tab**
This tab is basically acting like a filter, it displays all the transaction user has made for a sepecific category.

**Report Tab**
This tab provides useful insights and recommendations to user regaring to their expense habit.

-Some features may not be avaliable since this project is still under development, stay tune!
